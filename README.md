# Brain.NET

Brain.NET is a study project. There's nothing good about this (except being extremely lightweight, as it should anyways), but it can be pretty useful for interpreter study.

Brain.NET is developed using C# with .NET Framework 3.5, since this is what my class has been studying right now.

It doesn't implement important features like Lexer, Parser, AST nor anything like that. It's only able to interpret with all those steps skipped or, when possible, implicit.

Although I'd actually like to implement those steps, this is only a first study on Interpreters; I'm extremely hyped about Compilers, Interpreters and Programming Language Theory, but don't actually know much. So you can hope to see something like that later, probably written in Scala and for a different language (right now I'm thinking about L00P or PBrain, since they are a little bit more complex)

## Usage

1. If you're using Windows, just download the .exe from "Releases" tab
2. Save brainfuck code wherever you want or use something from examples folder
3. Open cmd/Terminal (I didn't actually test it on Linux to be honest since I did this at school and didn't have time to run, but since .NET Core I think it should run)
4. `BRAIN.NET.exe filename`
5. ???
6. **PROFIT**
